# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms

Core team members, and other contributors, are expected to follow the team norms outlined below.

### Team Values

- Team members are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect. Hostilities between team members will not be tolerated.

- Team members who need help should not be afraid to ask for it from fellow team members. So long as team members are not asking another team member to complete their work for them, team members are obligated to help another team member who asks for help if they are able.

- Should any disagreements in project direction arise, the core team members will vote on which way to proceed. In the case of a tie vote, the product owner for the current sprint will break the tie.

- Although team members are encouraged to be available on Discord as often as possible, team members are expected to respond to messages directed at them in no more than 24 hours, except in periods when a team member notifies the other team members of an extended absence in advance.

- If a team member is failing to deliver on their obligations, the scrum master for the current sprint will be responsible for making contact with that team member to inform them of this and come to a solution. If the scrum master is unable to make contact or agree with the team member on an appropriate solution, the scrum master will escalate the situation to the professor for further assistance.

### Sprint Cadence

- Sprints will last approximately two weeks. For an exact schedule, please consult [the course schedule](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/agile-development-and-devops/schedule/).

### Daily Standups

- At the beginning of each sprint, a survey will be sent out to determine the best time to hold our standups.

- In each standup, each team member will discuss what they have worked on since the last standup, what they plan to work on for the next standup, and whether or not they have anything blocking their progress (and, if they do have anything blocking their progress, what that is specifically).

- Although an effort will be made to schedule daily standups when all team members are available, if this is not possible, any team member(s) not able to attend any standup are expected to send their updates (consisting of an answer to all the points in the previous bullet) in Discord *before* the time the standup is scheduled to start.

### Coding Standards

- Team members are encouraged to use the VS Code IDE, and are obligated to match their code formatting with existing code.

- Each change to the code should be as small as possible while accomplishing the task. 

- Team members should never push non-working code. Care should be taken to ensure the app will function at any commit.

- Commit messages should be descriptive.

- All code should be self-documenting and obvious in function. All efforts should be made to use relevant variable and function names, etc.

- All bloat code should be removed, including dead or commented-out code.

## Git Workflow

- Contributions are expected to be made in branches.

- Branches should be named such that their names are relevant to the changes made in the code.

- Before a branch is ready to be merged into the `master` branch, the branch should be made into a draft pull request.

- When a branch is ready to be merged into the `master` branch, the pull request should be converted from a draft pull request into a normal pull request.

- All pull requests must be approved by another team member (not the one who made the pull request) before being merged into the `master` branch. 

## Contribution Rules

All contributions should follow the instructions in the "Coding Standards" and "Git Workflow" sections above.

## Environment Setup Instructions

Instructions for setting up a local development environment will follow once the project has any components started!
